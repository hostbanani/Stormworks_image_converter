# Stormworks_image_converter
Image to Text Converter for Microcontrollers.

This project is a Python program using the PIL (Python Imaging Library) library designed to convert images into a text format. This text format can be utilized in microcontrollers for displaying images on screens or similar purposes.

Key features of the program:

Loading images from files.
Resizing images.
Parsing GIF images into individual frames and merging them into a single image.
Converting images into a text format represented as a code understandable by microcontrollers.
Ability to specify image size, color sensitivity, and other parameters to achieve optimal results.
This project can be beneficial to developers working with microcontrollers who need a simple and efficient way to display images on screens with limited resources.
